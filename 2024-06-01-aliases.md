<h1>Aliases</h1>
* Linux `aliases` are ways for you to variabilize commands which you want to run 
  - `Aliases` allow you to call commands you predefined without having to entirely type them out
* Example: 

  ```bash
  alias gs="git status"
  alias ga="git add ."
  alias gc="git commit -m"
  alias gp="git push"

  ```

<h2>Persisting Aliases</h2>
* Issues when creating aliases is they are not persistent once the terminal is closed, they are required to be recreated
* A solution to this is to save these `aliases` in a `shell rc` file
  - Each shell has what is known as an `rc` file which contains saved commands that will be run every time the terminal boots up
  - In this case since we are using `bash` you will be creating a `~/.bashrc` file
    * The `rc` file always exists in your home directory and will always be a hidden file prepended with `.` 
* Example:
  
  ```bash
  touch ~/.bashrc # Creating a bashrc file sicne this is being run in a bash terminal
  vi ~/.bashrc # vi into file
   
  # .bashrc
  # add alias
  alias gs="git status"
  alias ga="git add ."
  alias gc="git commit -m"
  alias gp="git push"
  # save file

  source ~/.bashrc # sourcing file to pick up any new changes, only need to run once per change
  ```
