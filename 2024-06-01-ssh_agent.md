<h1>SSH and Keys</h1>
*  In Linux we have ways of authenticating to servers, like Github, sshr users, etc
*  We have what are called SSH keys which are `assymetric` 
  - `Assymetric` meaning a pair of keys are created, a public and a private 
  - These coordinate together to authenticate a user
  - NOTE: The private key must never be revealed publicaly, the public key however can be distributed anywhere
    * Imagine the private key as the key to a lock and the lock as the public key
<h2>Creating a pair of keys</h2>
* First you need to generate your own keys, there are various ways to do so

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen # This will prompt you to create a new key, you can specify name, path, and passphrase 
  # passphrase are just passwords for your keys
  # If no algorithm is specified rsa will be used
  # Keep in mind rsa algorithm is deprecated on many latest systems 
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/nzuni/.ssh/id_rsa): 
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
  Enter same passphrase again: 
  Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/nzuni/.ssh/id_rsa
  Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/nzuni/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  The key fingerprint is:
  SHA256:UmhfX2V5ab1zh11C4RHxm84yWWtNjQJfx3jxWfts/1c nzuni@BetoZunHP
  The key's randomart image is:
  +---[RSA 3072]----+
  |             .*=B|
  |       .     ..@X|
  |      o . o   **X|
  |     . o . + o.BO|
  |      . S   + .+X|
  |       .     .=oE|
  |             + =+|
  |              + o|
  |                o|
  +----[SHA256]-----+ 

  # Specifying an algorithm when creating an SSH key
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 # -t flag allows you to specify the algorithm 

  # locate keys
  ls ~/.ssh # with home directory a .ssh folder will be created
  ```
